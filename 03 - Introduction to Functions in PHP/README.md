### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
n this project, we’ll use PHP to write a function to fill in a Mad Libs story! Mad Libs are short stories with blank spaces, which get filled in by the user. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:
- A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
- Words to fill in those blanks.

“Roses are Red” poem example:

For this project, we provide the story, but it will be up to you to create a function that:
- Takes desired words as arguments.
- Returns the story with the words put into blanks in the right place.

Let’s begin!
